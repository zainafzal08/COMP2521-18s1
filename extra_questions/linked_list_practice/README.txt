| In this directory are _ Questions labeled     |
| q1.c, q2.c ... etc. At the top of each file   |
| is a description of the question and below is |
| some skeleton code for you to fill in. To     |
| test your code use ./test <question number>   |
| i.e to test question 1 you would do ./test 1  |
|                                               |
| The tests provided are by no means exhaustive |
| and you should talk to other students / write |
| your own tests to confirm you have a correct  |
| solution. If you fail a test go into the      |
| testing_files directory to see the input you  |
| failed on. Hit me up if you are confused/want |
| to fight me cause the tests are wrong         |
|                                               |
| These questions aren't meant to mimic a exam  |
| but rather give you something to practice     |
| your linked list skills on                    |
